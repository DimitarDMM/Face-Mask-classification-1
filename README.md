# Face-Mask-classification
### Model that will recognize whether a person wear a mask on his face or not / young or old person 
- The goal of your project is to create a robust classifier, to collect data and prepare custom dataset.  
- You will build a model that will recognize whether a person wear a mask on his face or not.
